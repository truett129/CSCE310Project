# Setting up the server
- First xampp must be downloaded on your computer
- Go into the xampp folder wherever you downloaded it and git clone this repo into the htdocs folder
- On the xampp control panel you want to start the Apache port
- Now you can go to localhost/(folder name goes here) and it should bring you to our project
